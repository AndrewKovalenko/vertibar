# vertibar
Minimalistic JavaScript utils library intended to replace *underscore* / *lodash*.

## Why?

Most methods people usually use from *underscore* or *lodash* already implemented natively in ES5 / ES6, but lots of developers keep pulling those monsters increasing size of their output bundles, polluting their code with purely readable `_` characters and slowing down their project srarting time.

  As for those methods which are still missing in "native" JS API - *underscore* / *lodash* provides pretty ugly API. For example, which code does look better / more readable: `const lone = _.clone(obj)` or `const clone = obj.deepCopy()`?

So my intention is to extend "native" JS API with methods we often find missing.


## Documentation

### String

`<string>.isURI()` - returns Bool `true` if string is a valid URI

### Array
`<array>.first` - is a readonly property which returns first element of an array or `undefined` if array is empty

`<array>.last` - is a readonly property which returns last element of an array or `undefined` if array is empty

`<array>.empty()` - returns Bool `true` if array is empty, otherwice returns `false`

`<array>.deepCopy()` - returns a [deep copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying) of an array

`<array>.flatten()` - flattens an array. **Example:** `[1, [2, 3, [4, 5] ] ].flatten(); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

`<array>.head` - is a readonly property implementing *head of collection concept* from functional programming. Returns the first element of an array

`<array>.tail` - is a readonly property implementing *tail of collection concept* from functional programming. Returns all but first elements from an array

`<array>.dedup([optionalCondition])` - returns array with no duplicated elements, if there where any.
  This function uses *strict equal* to compare elements by default. If custom *equal* condition needs to be used - a "condition" function may be passed as a parameter.

  This method expects optional condition function to have format:
  ```
  (element1, element2) => <return true for duplicated elements>
  ```

### Object
`<anyObject>.deepCopy()` - returns a [deep copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying) of an object

`Object.isUndefined(instance)` - a "static" method. Returns Bool `true` if `instance` is `undefined`

### Math
`Math.roundTo(number, decimals)` - rounds float point number to specified decimals using common mathematical rounding rules
